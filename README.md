# Inventory and Infection Simulation Project

## Overview
This repository contains all the necessary files for the "Inventory System and Infection Simulation with the SIR Model" project, which was part of the Simulação e Otimização course at Universidade de Aveiro. This project includes simulations for both inventory management systems and the spread of infectious diseases using the SIR model.

## Project Components

### Inventory System Simulation
- **Objective**: To simulate different inventory policies to determine the optimal inventory management strategies.
- **Methodology**: Utilizes event-based simulations to manage customer demand, inventory evaluation, order arrivals, and handling of expired items.

### Infection Simulation with the SIR Model
- **Objective**: To model the dynamics of infectious diseases within a population.
- **Methodology**: Implements both the Forward Euler and Runge-Kutta methods to solve the differential equations of the SIR model.
